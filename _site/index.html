      <h1><a href="/essence-of-learning">The essence of learning through repetitive rewarding steps</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I just had one of those AHA! moments when you understand fundamentals of something through some simple example.
Learning,why is it so hard to learn something;lots have been said about learning something new and how to master it in considerably small amount of time but with little emphasis on that one has to finally find suitable way of learning something either by finding his own pace,or following other people examples which mostly don`t work out so well if dont apply a sense of indivuality on it.
My case is little similar to what i have just said above by learning to play a game called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jelly-squares/id974529966?mt=8">Jelly Squares</a>
My friend was playing level 34 and insisted that i give it a try,which i did and failed terribly.In my opinion the game was not intuitive how to play it and also 34 was a no starting point.He changed the level to 22 but still it was undoable(its kind of puzzle) and we decided to start from an easy level,14.
He left me with his phone and went to play pool with some other friends while i was  still trying to figure out how  atleast to pass level 14.
Long story short i did pass level 14 and continued to other levels which little by little became more easier because i was getting used to the game.He kept checking which level i was on until i reached 34 which was where we started.He joined and also contributed to the play ,within 2 min we had already figured out how to pass it and it was fairly simple considering how  hard it seemed before we played it.</p>

      <h1><a href="/python-cheatsheet">Python cheatsheet Lookup List</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I decided to compile a cheatsheet  of useful links that helped me to undestarnd or fix a problem so it will be easy for me to check it whenever i forget how i fixed it.
The links are mostly answers to questions similar to ones i had that includes some examples as well.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In December 2015 i ve broken my laptop dual boot installation due to broken system depencies caused by shifting location.For those familiar with ubuntu,i  over messed with sources.list file and i couldn`t track some of the changes i ve made and ended up loosing the bootloader of of my laptop.
I got luck recovering it was pretty easy.I booted on live CD</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>i`ve never seen importance of blogging(I read many blogs) until the day i realized that not only blogging is to communicate and get feedback with/from others but also one of the best way to keep some of your best hacks well designed and organized for further consultation.
I dont see myself blogging often because  my intention are mainly to keep some of my opensource work together but i hope the little will be more meaningful.</p>
