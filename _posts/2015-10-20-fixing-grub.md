i`ve never given a tought  bout blogging(I read many blogs) until i realized that i need a way to keep some of of my hacks well  organized for further reading.I always end up forgetting  how i fixed something or loosing some of the best references i `ve seen on the internet. 
I guessed the best way to deal with those two issues i ALWAYS get is to blog about them so i could keep coming to check on them and hopefully,you,yes, you!!! you will give me an honest feedback.  

I decided that i will settle with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) and Jekyll mostly because they  were  highly recommended by [Quora Programming Community] (http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-blogging-platform-for-programmers) and i also wanted to overcome my lazyness of learning how to  use markdown.

After  googling for a while  i realized that to have a decent blog won`t just only be wrapping text with markdown synthax but will also templating(The Jekyll way),for simplicity reasons, i gave  a try   [ Barry Clark](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) tutorials on how to get started with   Jekyll and Github Pages .
I found it to be simple and easy  but as everything else,it requires attention if you want your pages to be rendered.

Well, As you could guess,this was my first post,testing markdown and Jekyll.I hope to write about my experience with Jekyll/Github Pages soon(or never).
