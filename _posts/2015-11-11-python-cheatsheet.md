I decided to compile a cheatsheet  of useful links that helped me to undestarnd or fix a problem so it will be easy for me to check it whenever i forget how i fixed it.
The links are mostly answers to questions similar to ones i had that includes some examples as well.

* [ instantiating class variables](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2681243/how-should-i-declare-default-values-for-instance-variables-in-python) .


I will keep updating the list.
