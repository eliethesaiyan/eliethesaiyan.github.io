In December 2015 i ve broken my laptop dual boot installation due to broken system depencies caused by shifting location.For those familiar with ubuntu,i  over messed with sources.list file and i couldn`t track some of the changes i ve made and ended up loosing the bootloader of of my laptop.
I got luck recovering it was pretty easy.I booted on live CD
