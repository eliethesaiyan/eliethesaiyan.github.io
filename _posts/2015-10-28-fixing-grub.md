I`ve never given a thought about blogging (I read many blogs) until I realized that I need a way to keep
some of my hacks well organized for further reading. I always end up forgetting how I fixed something or
losing some of the best references Iâ€™ve seen on the internet. I guessed the best way to deal with those
two issues I ALWAYS get is to blog about them so I could keep coming to check on them and hopefully, you,
yes, you!!! You will give me an honest feedback. I decided that I will settle with [Github Pages]
(http://pages.github.com) and Jekyll mostly because they  were  highly recommended by
[Quora Programming Community] (http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-blogging-platform-for-programmers)
and I also wanted to overcome my laziness of learning how to  use markdown. After googling for a while
I realized that to have a decent blog won`t just only be a wrapping text with markdown synthax but will
also templating [The Jekyll Way], for simplicity reasons, I gave a try [Barry Clark] 
(http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/] tutorials on how to get started
with Jekyll and GitHub pages. I found it to be simple and easy but as everything else, it requires
attention if you want your pages to be rendered. Well as you could guess, this was my first post,
testing markdown and Jekyll. I hope to write about my experience with Jekyll/GitHub pages soon (or never).
